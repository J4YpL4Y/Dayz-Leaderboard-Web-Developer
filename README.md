Intructions:

1- You need a mysql-.json folder intermediate or just enter the json manually in Database
2- Start Xampp or the program you use to run the database and the web

3- Copy and Paste Stats.php in Htdocs

4- Huala... already have your player database



Note: In my case I use a python-based broker. But you can find other examples based on php.
